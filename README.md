I didn't have that much time to complete this during the week, and for some reason decided it was a good idea to start this a day before it is expected to be completed. If I had more time to complete this, I think I would try to establish a better environment for connectivity between parts of the application, and I would've thought more carefully about what each part of the code is doing. Learning new technologies is never easy, so if I had to start again I would definitely try and familiarize myself with the technologies in use, and then set up a initial white-board design of the application. This way, I can take this in a step by step approach instead of trying to do everything at once like I did here. Obviously what I wrote here doesn't give much to work with, but I hope you can consider the time I spent on what I do have.
